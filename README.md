This Repository Contains 2 .py files one for Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) Algorithm and the other for Thompson Sampling Algorithm.
# Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)
The provided Python code for the Upper Confidence Bound Algorithm takes the multi-armed Bandit problem as an example and implements various steps solving it.The multi-armed bandit problem is a common challenge in reinforcement learning. 
The algorithm balances exploration and exploitation, selecting ads over a specified number of rounds to maximize cumulative reward. Leveraging a dataset containing ad rewards, the code iteratively applies UCB to prioritize ads with higher estimated rewards and uncertainty, updating selection statistics accordingly. 
The results are visualized through a histogram, revealing the frequency of ad selections. 
# Thompson Sampling
The provided Python code implements the Thompson Sampling algorithm for addressing the multi-armed bandit problem, a challenge in reinforcement learning involving exploration and exploitation trade-offs. 
Utilizing a dataset on ad rewards, the algorithm iteratively selects ads over N rounds, employing Thompson Sampling by sampling from Beta distributions. It dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, favoring ads with higher probabilities of being optimal. 
The code updates statistics based on observed rewards, maintaining counters for both successes and failures. Results are visualized through a histogram, illustrating the frequency of ad selections. 
# Real Life Applications
Both the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling algorithms offer valuable solutions in real-life applications. UCB excels in domains like online advertising, clinical trials, product recommendations, resource allocation, and dynamic pricing.

# DataSet Introduction/Explanation
The provided data appears to represent a matrix where each row corresponds to a user or a specific event, and each column corresponds to a different ad or action. The values in the matrix are binary (0 or 1), indicating whether a particular ad was selected (1) or not (0) by the user or during the event.

Interpretation: Each row represents a unique interaction, user, or event. Columns Ad 1 through Ad 10 represent different ads or actions. A value of 1 in a cell indicates the selection of the corresponding ad during that interaction, while 0 indicates non-selection.
Example: In the first row, Ad 1, Ad 5, and Ad 9 were selected (indicated by 1), while the others were not (indicated by 0).
Purpose: The data seems to be a binary matrix capturing user responses or event outcomes related to ad selections, potentially used for reinforcement learning algorithms like Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) or Thompson Sampling to optimize ad selection strategies based on historical data.

Understanding user engagement with ads or event outcomes is crucial for optimizing strategies in online advertising, A/B testing, or any scenario where dynamic decision-making is involved.
